```

- Now switch to the local terminal
- Connect to the Bastion Instance

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent)"

ssh-add ./Lab-Key.pem

ssh -A ec2-user@<Bastion Instance Public IP>
```

- Connect to the Private Instance

```bash
ssh ec2-user@<Private Instance Private IP>
```

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

- Enable Outbound Traffic from a Private Instance;
- Allocate an Elastic IP
- Create a NAT Gateway
- Update the Route Table

- Switch to the local terminal again

```bash
aws s3 ls
aws configure
aws s3 ls
```

- Remove NAT Gateway from Private Route Table

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

## Task 2: Create VPC Endpoint

-  At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose 'VPC'
- Click on the 'Endpoints' tab located on the left side of the page and select 'Create Endpoint'

```text
Name tag - optional  : Lab-Endpoint-<YourName>
Type                 : AWS services
Services
   Service Type      : Gateway
   Service Name      : com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3
Network settings
   VPC               : Lab-VPC-<YourName>
   Route tables      : Private Route Table-<YourName>
```

- Navigate to the 'Route Tables' section.
- Select the 'Private Route Table'
- In the 'Routes' tab, confirm that the endpoint has been automatically added

- Reconnect to the Private Instance's Local Terminal

```bash
aws s3 ls
aws s3 ls lab-bucket
aws s3 cp s3://lab-bucket/<FILE.png> .
ls
```
